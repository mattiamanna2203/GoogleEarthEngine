This repository is made up to show and preserve  scripts of google earth engine javascript used for homework of a geomatics course.
This course called GEOMATICS AND GEOINFORMATION' was a 6CFU exam of the  Data Science magistral degree.

I've divided the scripts in two folders.
- One relative to the homework about **spectral indexes**.
- One relative to the homework about **machine learning**.

I've also added two pdf that have  report and explanatory functions relative to the scripts.
